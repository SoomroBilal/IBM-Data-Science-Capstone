# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains the final capstone project for the IBM Professional Data Science Certification. The project is a culmination of the skills and knowledge I have gained throughout the course. The notebooks cover various aspects of data science, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more.
